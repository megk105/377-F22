This class covers the following chapters in [OSTEP](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/):

- [Chapter 3 A Dialogue on Virtualization](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/dialogue-virtualization.pdf)

## Additional Resources

- [GDB Basics (VSCode)](https://youtu.be/u6iXfpBDU3w). This is a video tutorial on how to use GDB inside of a VSCode terminal. This doesn't integrate with the VSCode debugger system, but it is helpful.
